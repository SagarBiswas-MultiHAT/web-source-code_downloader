Use a Virtual Environment
This is the recommended approach for managing Python packages without affecting the system environment.

1. Create a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Install pyautogui inside the virtual environment:
    pip install pyfiglet 
    pip install termcolor

4. Deactivate the virtual environment: 
    deactivate
